WHY tag8?

Why do I need tag8?

You could use tag8 to secure your daily routine items such as phone, wallet, key, laptop and also to secure your travel items such as passport, bag, camera.  So, while you are occupied in your pursuits, tag8 ensures that your valuables are secured.  tag8 also secures your pet.

Trusted with over 0.7 million registered valuables, tag8 has an 80%+ return rate across different categories of products.

How does tag8 help recover and/or return misplaced or lost valuables?

tag8 deploys a host of product-specific solutions to secure respective valuables.  The manner of working of each of the solutions is as follows.  

Lost & Found Tags <To know more on technology, click here LINK TO OUR TECHNOLOGIES LP>
The Lost & Found tags primarily rely on the Finder to return your lost valuables. 
The Lost & Found tag has a unique alphanumeric ID along with a ‘If Found, Return for Reward’ message. On finding the lost valuable, the Finder has six ways (i.e., phone call, WhatsApp message, scan QR code, drop message on  or tag8 app or connect through Google Assistant) to connect with the tag8 24x7 Customer Support Desk. On receiving the information, team tag8 immediately connects with the Finder and arranges to have the valuable picked up and delivered back to the doorstep of the Owner, from anywhere in the world. tag8 rewards the Finder for their integrity under its Finder Reward Programme. 
The Lost & Found pet tag (i.e., genie mart ag) is an exception to this.  In this case, the Finder scans the QR code on the genie smart tag, to directly connect with the pet parent.  On scan, the pet parent also receives the GPS location of the Finder.  There is no intervention from tag8.  
tag8 uses varied technology for securing their applications—passport <LINK TO LP>, bag <LINK TO LP>, key <LINK TO LP>, gadgets <LINK TO LP >, wallet <LINK TO LP> and pet <LINK TO LP>.
Dolphin Smart Trackers (leveraging Bluetooth Low Energy, i.e., BLE)<To know more on technology, click here LINK TO OUR TECHNOLOGIES>
The DOLPHIN Smart Tracker (DOLPHIN) <LINK TO DOLPHIN LP> is arguably the world’s most compact, high-range and efficient BLE tracker. You can use DOLPHIN to not only secure daily routine valuables like your wallet <LINK TO Wallet LP>, phone <LINK TO Phone LP>, key <LINK TO Key LP> and gadgets <LINK TO Gadgets LP>, but also to secure travel items like your passport <LINK TO Passport LP>, bag <LINK TO Bag LP> and camera <LINK TO GADGETS LP>. Pet parents can also secure their pet <LINK TO Pet LP>.
All you need to do is pair your phone (iOS or Android) with DOLPHIN. DOLPHIN helps you find your valuable, when misplaced, or alerts you if you are leaving it behind, or it is moving away from you. In case your valuable is out of range, you can view the last recorded GPS location or mark your valuable as lost, to activate community search. Every phone running the tag8 Tracker app joins in to help you find your valuable. 
Digital Tag–Find My Phone App (leveraging Phone GPS) <To know more on technology, click here <LINK TO OUR TECHNOLOGIES>
tag8 uses GPS technology to secure your smartphones through its Digital Tag–Find My Phone app. This is a phone tracking and anti-theft app which has an inbuilt stealth mode feature. The stealth mode feature gets activated automatically when any unusual activity is detected. The app then lets you know, via email, about the intrusion and provides you with an image and geo location of the unauthorised user accessing your phone. It also allows you to track your phone. The app gives the Finder or intruder an option to contact tag8 to return the phone. tag8 arranges to pick up the lost phone, drops it at your doorstep and rewards the Finder.

How does tag8 charge for its Lost & Found solutions?

All tag8 solutions are available for purchase on a one-time payment. The Digital Tag–Find My Phone app is the only exception wherein there is an annual charge.  

In addition to the one-time purchase amount, in the case where tag8 arranges for pick-up of the lost valuable from the Finder and delivers it to the Owner, the cost of logistics is charged to the Owner on actual. Due to the tie ups with global logistics companies, tag8 gets a preferential rate. Prior to incurring any such cost, tag8 provides an estimate to the Owner and gets their approval. 

tag8 does not charge a convenience fee for arranging the pick-up and delivery of lost valuables.

The Owner ID on the tag helps maintain your privacy as you do not need to display your contact information on your valuable.

Unable to identify the Owner 
The logistics of return were cumbersome
The risk of being held accountable by the Owner for any missing item, especially items lost in public transportation
No personal motivation
Just lack of time 

The tag8 solution has been built specifically to take into account these challenges.  Our Finder Reward Programme has registered a return of over 80% on several categories of lost valuables.

You can also put two passports in the same Passport Finder Case, one under each flap; or up to six passports in the Family Passport Finder Case <LINK TO PASSPORT LP>.
You need to Register the Lost & Found tag at the back of the passport to activate it.

3.	What is your policy for reimbursement in case of loss of passport?
In case we are unable to recover your lost passport, we reimburse you the cost of getting a new passport. For a passport issued by Indian authorities, the amount of reimbursement is equal to the actual cost of obtaining a new passport under the Tatkal Scheme. For passports issued by another country, our reimbursement is for the actual cost incurred (i.e., the charges paid to the embassy) in getting a new passport, subject to a limit of Rs 10,000. 
In the case of loss of a Family Passport Finder Case, the reimbursement policy would apply to the one passport that had been registered with tag8.

Documents to be submitted for claiming the reimbursement are:

Documentary evidence of loss of passport (a copy of FIR or lost report filed with the police or any government authority
A copy of the application filed for a new passport from the Passport Seva Kendra or foreign passport issuing authority
The original receipt for the application fee for the new passport

The reimbursement will be made within seven working days of submitting the completed set of documents.

Please note that the reimbursement policy is valid only in case the passport is lost during travel or during the process of applying for a visa or for any other travel-related purposes.  


4.	I have misplaced my passport. I kept it somewhere and I am not able to locate it. Can I claim reimbursement for the cost of getting a new passport?

No. Our Lost & Found services are applicable only in case of loss of passport at a public place, where there is a possibility for a Finder to find the passport and contact us to return it. In case you have lost the Smart Passport Case, you could ring DOLPHIN attached to the case through the tag8 Tracker app in your phone. If the passport is within DOLPHIN’s range, you will locate it.

Our services do not apply in case you misplace your passport at home or have kept it somewhere and cannot find it or recall where you have last seen it. In such a situation, the reimbursement clause will not apply.

5.	What is the Passport Expiry Alert feature?

Most countries require that your passport has at least six months validity remaining after your intended departure from the country you are visiting. It is advisable to check with Embassies of the countries you are planning to visit for passport validity requirements.

Therefore, we send you an alert one year before your passport is due to expire, to ensure that your travel plans are not hindered on account of an expired passport.

6.	What is the RFID blocking feature in Passport Finder Case?

Radio Frequency Identification Device is known as RFID. An RFID microchip is present in several credit/debit cards and also in some passports. These days identity theft via RFID readers (i.e., skimming) is growing. A person with a skimming gadget can steal your credit card number or personal information just by being in your proximity. RFID blocking prevents the microchip from being read, thereby keeping your data safe.

The RFID blocking feature in the Passport Finder Case prevents others from stealing your personal information from the Passport Finder Case. Information in the passport/credit/debit cards kept in the Passport Finder Case cannot be scanned by such electronic thieves.

7.	How long does it typically take to find a lost passport?

Passport cases with Lost & Found tags are generally found within 4-6 hours of getting lost. However, since we rely on the Finder to inform us about the lost passport, the timeline could differ significantly from case to case.

In case you are using a Smart Passport Case with DOLPHIN, you can use the tag8 tracker app to find your passport as soon as you realise you have lost it. For details on the features of DOLPHIN which help in finding the lost valuable, please click here <LINK TO DOLPHIN LP> 

8.	My travel insurance covers the loss of my passport. How is your Lost & Found service different from an insurance policy?

An insurance claim gets activated only when the passport is declared lost.  An insurance company, based on the specific policy, settles the claims made by the traveller.  In the case of tag8, the primary objective is to find the lost passport.  For a traveller, the best-case scenario is getting the lost passport back. It saves them from changing travel plans, going through the trouble of getting a travel document from the embassy that is required to travel back home and once home, having to apply for a new passport and visas. For several people, their passports also carry significant emotional value, given its the authentic record of all their travels with dates.

In addition, to claim travel insurance, a customer needs to prove that he or she wasn’t negligent.  In the case of tag8, the reimbursement is subject to the fulfilment of the stated condition, no questions asked.  Also, tag8 services are for a lifetime, while travel insurance policies correspond to either the specific travel or at best is on an annual plan.   

tag8 works with several insurance companies to provide tag8 solutions to their customers, as a Value-added Service.

3.	What is the benefit of SITA WorldTracer mentioned on the Bag Tag?

SITA is a global leader in airline baggage management and tracking. tag8 is a SITA member. SITA provides the WorldTracer Code which is used by more than 500 airlines and ground handlers at over 2,800 airports worldwide. Being a global tracing and matching database, it can trace bags faster. The WorldTracer Code works in the following manner:
When a passenger realises that luggage is missing at the airport, he/she files a Property Irregularity Report (PIR) report with the airline staff. The airlines that use the WorldTracer Code, update the details of the missing baggage in the WorldTracer System. Details such as the make and model of the bag, colour of the bag, description of the contents or any special identification on bags is updated into the system under an AHL (Advise if Holding) file.
In a similar manner, whenever an airline staff member finds lost baggage, they update similar details into the system under an OHD (On Hand Baggage) file. 
The system matches the AHL files with the OHD files. The airline baggage tracing staff then picks up the OHD file with highest matching percentage and coordinates with the other airline who has the bag in their custody.
An additional benefit that the Lost & Found bag tags provide, is that the baggage handling staff who find your lost bag, inputs the tag8 unique Owner ID in the WorldTracer system. The WorldTracer server sends information to the tag8 server about the location of the bag. We then inform our customer and provide them with their file reference number, so that they can follow-up with the concerned airline for the recovery of the lost bag.


4.	If I put Lost & Found Bag Tag on my check-in bag and the bag is lost by the airline, can the tag improve the chances of finding my bag?

Yes. Please refer to the response to Question 3 of our Bag section. 


5.	If I register the Lost & Found Bag Tag in my name, can anyone else in my family also use it?

Yes, the Lost & Found bag tag can be used by anyone in your family. However, it is advisable to update the details of the bag being secured by the tag on our website. Also, in case the bag with this tag is lost by your family member and found by someone, the intimation will be sent on the number which is registered with us.


6.	My travel insurance covers the loss of my bag. How is your service different from an insurance policy?

An insurance claim gets activated once the bag is declared lost.  An insurance company, based on the specific policy, settles the claims made by the traveller.

DOLPHIN has a replaceable battery. The battery life is typically over 6 months though that would vary depending upon usage. When needed, you can replace the old battery with a new one (CR2016).

Please note, that the battery is splash proof only. To avoid irreparable damage, do not immerse the device in water.

Is there a Warranty period?
There is a 1-year warranty on manufacturing defects, i.e., defects in the material and manufacturing process. It does not cover product components that are subject to normal wear and tear, or fragile components (such as, switches, batteries or the casing). Should there be a manufacturing defect within 1 year of your purchase, it will be repaired or replaced free of charge. However, consumer-inflicted damage, improper use or incorrect maintenance of the product will void the warranty.

What is the range of DOLPHIN? 

DOLPHIN relies on Bluetooth to communicate with the app. Therefore, Bluetooth is an important permission to enable when you are pairing DOLPHIN with your phone.
DOLPHIN helps you secure your valuables within a range of up to 100 feet or 30 meters (clear sight). The effective range of Bluetooth signals may, however, be impacted by the environment and the extent of obstructions (such as furniture or walls in the way) between DOLPHIN and the phone.
Even when DOLPHIN goes out of the Bluetooth connectivity range, you can check its last known GPS location on the app. Further, this information gets updated automatically whenever anyone using the tag8 tracker app passes by your valuable and comes within its Bluetooth range. 

Can I know how far is my valuable from the phone?
When DOLPHIN is within the Bluetooth range of the phone, the screen shows that DOLPHIN is connected to the phone. The more green signals you see on the screen, the stronger the signal is and that means the closer you are to DOLPHIN. The lesser the green signals, the greater the distance between DOLPHIN and the phone. So when you are looking for your lost valuables and the green circles start increasing on the phone, it means you are getting closer to your valuable. However, please note that the strength of Bluetooth signals may get impacted by obstructions in the environment.

Can I modify the volume of the alert sound of DOLPHIN?
No, presently it is not possible to modify the volume of the alert sound of DOLPHIN.

How do I take care of the leather?
Leather, just like our skin is a natural product that needs attention if you want it to last as long as possible and look as good as new—or better. 
Cleaning your wallet:
Your wallet will most likely become dirty from daily use, so it is recommended that you clean it with a damp cloth as soon as you notice some dirt or stains. If the dirt or stain has already set in, use a good leather cleaner to remove it. A good leather cleaner or conditioner will only remove the stain and not the dye. Do not use soap or detergents as they may affect the dye or treatment of the leather. 
In case your wallet gets wet, gently wipe the surface clean with a dry, clean cloth and allow it to dry at room temperature. Keep your wallet closed (bifold), don't leave it open or it will not lay flat anymore when folded. To keep the original shape of your leather wallet insert a credit card on each side of the billfold, do this only after you let the wallet dry for about an hour. Do not use a blow dryer or expose your wallet to extreme heat since that will cause the leather to become wrinkled.

Conditioning your wallet: 
You will know that your wallet needs conditioning if you start seeing a few cracks. Leather requires some moisture to keep it smooth and soft. 
Gently apply a leather cream or leather moisturiser to your wallet. Only apply a small amount, you can always add more later if you feel that your wallet is still dry.
Do not let your wallet get too dried out before applying moisturiser.
